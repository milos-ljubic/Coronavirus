# Coronavirus

In this assignment, we have a matrix of chars representing the proximity of people in the world. The task is the spreading of coronavirus. We need to count days of spreading, number of infected, number of recovered, and number of uninfected. We use several methods to count these numbers. 

In the beginning, we make two methods. That methods represent the population on the starting day and the day after that. Also, we have a method that switches from today's matrix into tomorrow's matrix. 

Besides these three, we have three more methods. The first one is used to checking is the virus still spreading? And second two, for counting days of spreading, and for counting the effects of spreading.

In the coronavirus method are all those methods implemented. We use this method in the main method to solve our task.
